//XML - old way of sending data:
//Example below for data: name -> todd, email -> todd@gmail.com, age -> 24

{
    /* <name>
    <first>Todd</first>
    <last>Smith</last>
</name>
<email>todd@gmail.com</email> */
}

//JSON: extremely common these days, looks like JS, but there are differences,
//can not store functions, all keys are strings in double quotes.
//need to be aprsed
